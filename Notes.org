** WIP new command						     :v0_1_0:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     camp new myapp
   #+END_SRC

   This should:
   - create a new directory
   - add a .gitignore
   - add a project.clj
     - includes lein-esque deps
   - add src/myapp/core.clj

** BACKLOG deps command 					     :v1_0_1_0:
   - fetch deps from nuget
     - or maybe look at packet?

** BACKLOG compile command                                           :v_0_1_0:
   - fetch deps in not already there
   - construct a Clojure.Compiler command line
   - output goes in targets dir

** BACKLOG repl                                                      :v_0_1_1:
   - just fire up a repl with the project loaded for now.

** BACKLOG nrepl                                                     :v_0_1_2:
   - supposedly it "almost works"

** BACKLOG templates                                                 :v_0_1_3:
   - I like the way leiningen templates work. Something like that...

** BACKLOG assembly merging                                          :v_0_1_4:
   - ILMerge has issues.
   - Maybe try Jeffery Richter idea
     - have a stub EXE with assemblies embedded as resources
     - there was some problem with that, though, too, AFAIR.
   

* Ideas

** Camping Metaphor

*** Winnebago or One-Person Tent
    - You can go crazy and :require all the things (Winnebago), or
      travel light and keep it simple.

*** Base Camp
    - You can create one project, then take what you want for it and
      go on up the mountain to the next project, establishing a new
      camp.
    - Mountaineering with a base camp and camp I, camp II, ...
      - Vague...I am really thinking about being able to quickly
        re-use assets (think: "I have bootstrap over there
        already. Just use that!", or "On a plane. Can't restore
        packages. Please re-use package I already downloaded over
        there.", like maven.)
    - Also like the George Carlin sketch about going to Honolulu with
      a bunch of stuff, then taking less stuff for a couple of days to
      Maui, then even less stuff somewhere else...

*** Camping is just fun

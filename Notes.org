* Features

** TODO new command :v1:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     camp new myapp
   #+END_SRC

   This should:
   - create a new directory
   - add a .gitignore
   - add a project.clj
     - includes lein-esque deps
   - add src/myapp/core.clj

** BACKLOG deps command :v1:
   - fetch deps from nuget
     - or maybe look at packet?

** BACKLOG compile command :v1:
   - fetch deps in not already there
   - construct a Clojure.Compiler command line
   - output goes in targets dir

** BACKLOG assembly merging
   - ILMerge has issues.
   - Maybe try Jeffery Richter idea
     - have a stub EXE with assemblies embedded as resources
     - there was some problem with that, though, too, AFAIR.
